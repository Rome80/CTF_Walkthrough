After that, I searched the value of the copyright field, "OWoodflint". Then i saw the image of of the Oliver Owoodflint.

## What city is this person in?

Found this github repositorium /https://github.com/OWoodfl1nt/people_finder) where Oliver says his current location

## Whats the SSID of the WAP he connected to?

To find the SSID of the WAP (Wireless Access Point), I found a website which through the coordinates and the BSSID (MAC Address), I can know the exact SSID. The SSID is a customizable name given to a WAP. 

First, on Twitter it is published the BSSID

Then also in the metadata of the image (in the first question), we have the coordinates. The website is wigle.net

Zooming in on the marker discloses the SSID of OWoodflintâ€™s WiFi as "UnileverWiFi".
